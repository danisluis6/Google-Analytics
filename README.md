# Tracking Activity

â‡’ Automatic Screen Tracking
Take a look below:

    <!-- Enable automatic Activity measurement -->
    <bool name="ga_autoActivityTracking">true</bool>

If you set ga_autoActivityTracking to true in app_tracker.xml, all the activities tracking will be automatically. However if you want to keep a name to screen, you need to mention the activity screen name in app_tracker.xml.
If you have multiple activities, you have to mention the screen names for every activity.
