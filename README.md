# Tracking Event
â‡’ Take notes:

Event tracking allows us to record any kind of user interaction within the app. The interaction can be anything like button press,
selecting a spinner, swiping gestures, completing game level etc.,

Event tracking accepts four parameters. Category, Action, Label and Value. Below is a simple event example when user presses
the book download button.
